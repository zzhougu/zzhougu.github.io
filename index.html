    <b>Abstract:</b> Deep learning has been shown to be an effective method for 
    solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding the PDE residual 
    into the neural network loss function. In this paper, we design a methodology
    that utilizes deep learning to simultaneously solve and estimate canonical
    continuous-time general equilibrium models in financial economics, including
    (1) industrial dynamics of firms and (2) macroeconomic models with financial
    frictions. Through these applications, we illustrate the advantages of our
    method: generality, simultaneous solution and estimation, leveraging the 
    state-of-art machine-learning techniques, and handling large state space.
